Here is a bash script that enables the use of bookmarks when navigating folders in the shell. 

### Installation (Linux and Mac)
1. Clone the repository with `git clone git@bitbucket.org:troelsfrostholm/here.git`

2. Source the bash script file named `here`, e.g. by adding the following line to ~/.bashrc:
`source /path/to/repository/here`

### Usage
Creating a bookmark for the current folder:
`> here [bookmark-name]`

Going to a bookmarked folder
`> go [bookmark-name]`

Listing all bookmarks and the folders they point to
`> where`

Listing the path pointed to by a bookmark
`> where bookmark-name`

Removing a bookmark
`> del bookmark-name`

### Technical details

Here saves the bookmark information in the plain-text file ~/.here

The above four commands are implemented as bash functions, so they will shadow any program that may already be installed, called here, go, where or del. 

### Acknowledgements
This script is my reimplementation of functionality originally thought out, programmed and used by my masters thesis supervisor Ã…ke Nordlund. Please DON'T contact him regarding this software, as he has nothing to do with this implementation, and he is busy figuring out how our solar system was created.
